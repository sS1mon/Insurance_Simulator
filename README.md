# Insurance_Simulator
## Why?
* This mini-project is here for me to **try out technologies** that I haven't had in my hands yet.
* To not get bored and use my time usefully... <br>
* To **sharpen my skills** and find new and more complex ways to solve problems. <br>


## What's next?
### In short run:
* Implementation of H2
* Implementation of SwaggerUI
* Integration tests 
* Module tests 

### In long run:
* Implement JWT
* Create proper authorization and authentication
* Upload it on hosting server

## **You**
Do you have any advice/ideas for me to try out or implement new things? <br>
